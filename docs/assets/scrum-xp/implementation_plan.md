# Implementation Plan for Scrum XP BPMN in EuRecomendo Project

## Structure and Location

1. **Create a dedicated section** in the existing `docs/Base/1.3.ModelagemBPMN.md` file specifically for Scrum XP methodology.

2. **Create a new directory** for Scrum XP BPMN diagrams in the `docs/assets/scrum-xp/` directory.

## Content Development

1. **Scrum XP Methodology Section:**
   - Introduction to Scrum and XP methodologies separately
   - Explanation of how they can be integrated (Scrum XP)
   - Benefits of using Scrum XP for the EuRecomendo project
   - Key roles, events, and artifacts in Scrum XP

2. **BPMN Diagrams:**
   - Create a main BPMN diagram showing the complete Scrum XP process flow
   - Create sub-diagrams for specific aspects:
     - Sprint Planning and User Story Creation
     - Daily Stand-ups and Pair Programming
     - Sprint Review and Retrospective
     - Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery workflow

3. **Practical Implementation:**
   - How the EuRecomendo team will use Scrum XP
   - Adaptation of the methodology to the specific needs of the project
   - Tools and techniques to support Scrum XP implementation

## Technical Implementation

1. **BPMN Diagram Creation:**
   - Use draw.io or similar tool to create the BPMN diagrams
   - Follow the BPMN 2.0 standard notation
   - Use consistent styling with other project diagrams
   - Export both .drawio source files and .png/.svg images for documentation

2. **Documentation:**
   - Create markdown files following the project's documentation standards
   - Link diagrams appropriately in the documentation
   - Include version history and attribution
   - Add references to standard Scrum and XP resources

## Scrum XP BPMN Content Outline

The Scrum XP BPMN section should include:

1. **Introduction to Scrum XP Integration**
   - Brief overview of Scrum and XP individually
   - Explanation of how they complement each other
   - Benefits of the combined approach for EuRecomendo

2. **Key Components of Scrum XP**
   - Scrum elements: Sprints, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, User Stories
   - XP elements: Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, Test-Driven Development
   - Combined practices: Short iterations, Customer involvement, Continuous feedback

3. **BPMN Process Flow**
   - Project Initialization Phase
   - Sprint Planning Process
   - Daily Development Workflow
   - Testing and Quality Assurance Process
   - Sprint Review and Retrospective
   - Release Process

4. **Application in EuRecomendo Project**
   - Team structure and roles
   - Sprint cadence and planning
   - Technical practices adoption
   - Quality control mechanisms
   - Communication and collaboration tools

5. **BPMN Diagrams**
   - Overall Scrum XP Process Flow
   - Detailed Sub-processes
   - Swim lanes for different roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team)

## Implementation Steps

1. Update the main BPMN markdown file to include Scrum XP section
2. Create the necessary BPMN diagrams
3. Add detailed content about Scrum XP methodology
4. Link the diagrams in the documentation
5. Update version history
6. Add bibliography references
